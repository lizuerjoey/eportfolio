            <p class="text">
              For a UI/UX module assignment, a member of each team was required to revamp any digital application (e.g. website, microsite and order machine etc.) of a company chosen. My team chose Eagle Cinematics. However, after contacting with Eagle Cinematics, they do not have any EDM or Microsite to start of with. Therefore, I would need to create one.

              <p class="text">
                Our team has created a 'dummy' theme for this assignment, which is Eagle Wings celebrating their 1st year anniversary and they plan to target students.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                The proposed EDM will be sent out to EagleWings Cinematics members, targeting internal users; students to celebrate their one-year anniversary. They plan to appeal to young consumers since their cinema theatre is situated in the centre of schools like Ngee Ann and Singapore Polytechnic and Universities like NUS. Additionally, promotions and deals appeal well to students due to their tight budget and they have more free time compared to a working adult who works a 9-6pm shift every day.

                Step 2: Heuristic Evaluation
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Since EagleWings Cinematics do not have EDM or a microsite, I conducted the heuristic evaluation on their competitor, Golden Village. Then, apply what I had analysed to my proposed EDM for EagleWings. 
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Golden Village EDM has hit high marks in all areas, scoring at least a 4 in aspects such as Human, Forgiving, Self-evident, Predictable, Efficient and Trustworthy. However, it did not score as well for accessibility. It didnâ€™t cater to colour-blind users. One reason could be that, for a media company, they cater to a larger audience that are not color-blind. However, one can never rule out the possibility that a colour-blind user cannot watch a movie. Therefore, in the later stage of design, not only do I have to consider the majority of users but colour blind users as well.
